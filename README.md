# Credit_Risk_Prediction_RF
This is a classic problem where the goal is to predict whether an individual's credit risk is "Good" or "Bad" based on the provided features. You could use various machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model that takes into account attributes like age, gender, job, housing, savings, checking account status, credit amount, duration, and purpose to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan.

Details of the dataset:
Age: The age of the individual. This is likely a numerical variable representing the age in years.

Sex: The gender of the individual. This is likely a categorical variable with values such as 'Male' and 'Female'.

Job: The occupation or job type of the individual. This is likely a categorical variable indicating the type of job or employment status.

Housing: The type of housing the individual has. This could be a categorical variable with values like 'Own', 'Rent', 'Free', indicating different housing arrangements.

Saving accounts: The status of the individual's saving accounts. This is likely a categorical variable representing the level of savings or financial status.

Checking account: The status of the individual's checking account. Similar to 'Saving accounts', this is likely a categorical variable representing the financial status of the checking account.

Credit amount: The amount of credit (loan) requested or obtained. This is a numerical variable indicating the monetary value.

Duration: The duration of the credit (loan) in months. This is a numerical variable representing the loan term.

Purpose: The purpose for which the credit (loan) is being requested. This is likely a categorical variable indicating the reason for obtaining the credit.

Risk: This column represents the risk associated with the credit (loan). It could be a categorical variable with values like 'Good' and 'Bad', indicating the creditworthiness of the individual.
